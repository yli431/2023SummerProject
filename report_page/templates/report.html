          <p class="light">This project aimed to determine the affordability of house prices in Christchurch and create a database of related data that may affect the real estate market.<br>The data collected and analyzed were presented on a website, where a chat robot answered questions about the database and performed a simple analysis.<br>Various charts were used to show possible relationships between the dataset and property values, such as family income, mortgage rates, and rental growth.<br>Thus, the housing affordability in Christchurch could be inferred.</p>

          <p class="light">After experiencing a market that the pandemic has shaken, Christchurch remains the most affordable city among the top three big cities in New Zealand, especially for first-home buyers. The average house prices started increasing after 2020, peaked in 2022, then fell 17.8&#37;, and appeared to bottom out in May 2023. Since bottoming out, NZ house prices have increased by 3.76&#37;.<br>The average price of a Christchurch property is $754,858(CoreLogic, December 2023), which is 2.82&#37; up over the last 12 months. Christchurch house prices soared after COVID-19; however, after that peak in February 2022, house prices fell 10.72&#37; before bottoming out in June 2023. Since then, they have risen 4.43&#37; till today.<br>Rents have been steadily increasing in Christchurch. Over the last four years (2019-2023), the median rent has gone up $130 a week, which is 7.46&#37; a year on average. Mortgage rates kept increasing after 2022 to control the significant inflation in NZ. It has already shown a positive impact on CPI figures from the end of 2023, though it has brought pressure to families with higher mortgage loans.</p>
